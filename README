This branch is for the Fluid Imaging (http://www.fluidimaging.com) 
and Battelle (http://www.battelle.org) joint venture to produce a 
submersible, autonomous FlowCAM.

This branch exists mostly to keep a known good and stable environment
for the Gumstix Overo code used in the project. 

It is based on my minimal branch with a custom image recipe.
